# Term Project Report — Secure Build

> Fill in every section. Keep the headings. Total **100 pts** (see rubric at the end).
> This is **team work** (2–3). Do not share your report with other teams.

## Cover

| Field | Value |

## 1. Executive Summary
*(½ page) What the app is, how many findings by severity, and the overall risk before vs. after your fixes.*

---

## 2. System Scope & Function
- What the application does; in-scope components and endpoints.
- **Data-Flow Diagram (DFD):** processes, data stores, external entities, **trust boundaries** (insert image).

---

## 3. Threat Model — STRIDE  *(20 pts)*

| Element / data flow | S | T | R | I | D | E | Top threat & mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | |

*Then rank the top 5 risks by likelihood × impact.*

---

## 4. Vulnerability Findings  *(25 pts)*

One block per finding (copy as needed):

### Finding F-01 — Unsalted MD5 Password Hashing
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| CWE | CWE-916 / CWE-327 |
| OWASP 2025 | A04 Cryptographic Failures |
| Severity | High |
| Location | `project/starter-app/app.py:67-69`, `116-117`, and `128-130` |
| Reproduction | Obtain the two unsalted MD5 values from NoteVault's `seed()` data and run Hashcat in raw-MD5 mode (`hashcat -m 0`). The Week 3 exercise recovered both seeded passwords through offline guessing. |
| Impact | Anyone who obtains the user table can test password guesses quickly without contacting the application. Recovered passwords can compromise NoteVault accounts and may create additional risk if a user reused the same password elsewhere. |
| Evidence | Week 3 Hashcat result shown below |

**Recommended mitigation:** Replace MD5 with Argon2id for new passwords and use rehash-on-login to migrate a correctly verified legacy MD5 record. Argon2id applies a unique salt and deliberately expensive time and memory costs, making offline guessing substantially harder.

## 5. Remediation  *(25 pts)*

Per finding: the fix, **before/after** code, and the commit that implements it.

### Fix for F-01
```diff
- vulnerable line
+ fixed line
```
- **Why this fixes it:** …
- **Commit:** `<hash>`
- **Proof the exploit now fails:** (screenshot)

---

## 6. Supply-Chain Hardening  *(15 pts)*
- **SBOM** (CycloneDX) generated — attach `sbom.json`, note component count.
- **Artifact signed & verified** with Cosign — paste the `cosign verify` output.
- One-paragraph **SLSA** self-assessment (which level, why).

---

## 7. Security CI Pipeline  *(10 pts)*
- Link to the GitHub Actions workflow (SAST + SCA + secret scanning).
- Screenshot of a build **failing** on a HIGH/CRITICAL finding.
- How the gate is configured (what fails the build).

---

## 8. Conclusion & Reflection  *(5 pts — clarity)*
- Residual risks and what you'd harden next.
- Lessons learned.

---

## Appendix
- Tools used, references (OWASP/CWE links), and the team's task split.

## Grading rubric (100)

| Criterion | Pts |
|---|---|
| Threat model quality & completeness (§3) | 20 |
| Vulnerability findings — correctness, CWE/OWASP mapping, depth (§4) | 25 |
| Remediation quality — correct, minimal, well-explained (§5) | 25 |
| Supply-chain hardening — SBOM + signing + provenance (§6) | 15 |
| CI pipeline — works, fails build appropriately (§7) | 10 |
| Presentation & report clarity (§1, §8) | 5 |

*All work stays within the [ethics policy](../ETHICS.md).*
